Perfect ‚Äî here's the next doc: `CONFIG.md`. This explains how `.dotmanrc` works and what options you can tweak. I've kept the tone fun but a little more composed, and dialed the emoji count way down.

# Configuring dotman (`.dotmanrc`)

Dotman works out of the box, but you can tweak how it behaves using a simple config file located at:

```bash
~/.dotmanrc
````

This file controls the core behavior of dotman ‚Äî what files get synced, how they get synced, and whether or not it keeps Git in the loop.

---

## Example `.dotmanrc`

```bash
# Where your dotfiles live (in version control)
DOTFILES_DIR=$HOME/.dotfiles

# Use symlinks instead of copying files
USE_SYMLINKS=true

# Automatically commit changes to Git after sync
AUTO_COMMIT=true

# Backup before overwriting anything
ENABLE_BACKUPS=true

# Your default editor for viewing/restoring files
EDITOR=nvim
```

---

## Option Breakdown

### `DOTFILES_DIR`

This is where your dotfiles are stored, versioned, and organized.

* Default: `~/.dotfiles`
* This directory is initialized as a Git repo (or should be)
* All synced files live here

**Important:** Make sure this is under version control.

---

### `USE_SYMLINKS`

* `true`: dotman will create symlinks from your home dir to your repo
* `false`: dotman will copy files instead

**Tip:** Use symlinks if you want real-time changes. Use copy if you're cautious and prefer a snapshot approach.

---

### `AUTO_COMMIT`

If enabled, dotman will automatically commit dotfile changes after each sync from home to repo.

This is great if:

* You forget to commit regularly
* You want a log of every change

If you're picky about commits, set this to `false` and commit manually.

---

### `ENABLE_BACKUPS`

Before any sync or overwrite, dotman will:

* Back up the existing file (in a backup directory or archive)
* Let you restore from these backups via the menu

This is your safety net. Keep it enabled unless you like living dangerously.

---

### `EDITOR`

When dotman needs to show diffs, file contents, or lets you manually inspect commits, this is the editor it uses.

* Default: `nvim`
* You can use `vim`, `nano`, `code -w`, etc.

---

## Pro Tips

* Always sync *before* making changes on a new system
* You can create different `.dotmanrc` files for different machines (and use a wrapper script to switch)
* Backups are stored in `~/.dotman/backups` ‚Äî keep an eye on disk space if you change files often
